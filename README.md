# ULMT-based implementation of the GNU OpenMP runtime

This project provides an implementation of OpenMP for the C, C++, and Fortran compilers in the GNU Compiler Collection which relies on the newest *User-Level-Micro-Thread* (ULMT) technology. In more detail, this solution extends the GNU OpenMP (GOMP) runtime with newer facilities that are aimed to support ULMT-based execution of tasks still in accord with the tasking-model presented in the <a href="https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/openmp-4.5.pdf">OpenMP specification 4.5</a>.

ULMT differs from the classical *user-level-thread* (ULT) technology in that it allows to switch execution of tasks at arbitrary points in time. This is possible by making tasks capable of sliding out from the *control-flow-graph* (CFG) provided for the application at compile time, whereas the asychronous variation of the thread program flow is obtained through dedicated hardware support (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/HPDCS/IBS-Support-ULMT">IBS interrupt support for ULMT technology</a>).
