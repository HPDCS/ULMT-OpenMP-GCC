# ULMT-based implementation of the GNU OpenMP runtime

This project provides an implementation of OpenMP for the C, C++, and Fortran compilers in the GNU Compiler Collection which is based on the newest User-Level-Micro-Thread (ULMT) technology. In more detail, this solution extends the GNU OpenMP (GOMP) runtime with newer facilities that are aimed to support ULMT-based execution of tasks. This is still in accord with the tasking-model described in the OpenMP specification 4.5.
