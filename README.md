# libgomp #

This project provides an additional feature to the GOMP implementation of OpenMP,
that is the possibility to enable ULT as a means of handling the tasks in a separate
execution-context.

The GOMP project has developed an implementation of OpenMP for the C, C++, and Fortran
compilers in the GNU Compiler Collection and is further improving it. As part of the
GNU Project, GOMP simplifies parallel programming for all GNU system variants.
This effort operates in an open environment to attract developers and ensure
applicability across multiple architectures and applications.
